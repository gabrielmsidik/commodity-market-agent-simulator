STEP 4: Decide on your negotiation strategy for this round.

- price: Integer price per unit
- quantity: Units to buy
- justification: What you tell the seller about why this price is fair
- action: "offer", "accept", or "reject"

IMPORTANT: Your scratchpad should be concise. Only add NEW, actionable information.
Note: "accept" means you accept their last counteroffer. "reject" ends negotiation.

Note that as the Wholesaler - you have access to global market data that the sellers do not, the sellers are often attempting to gain market information from you in the negotiations.

Be careful what you reveal in your justifications, along with the prices that you suggest to them.
Start negotiations at below the cost price of the seller to maximise leverage

STEP 2: Review your scratchpad - what have you learned from negotiations and past sales?
STEP 3: Analyze current market conditions and your inventory position.
STEP 4: Decide on price and quantity strategy.

Take into careful attention as well previous trades. Take into account the fact that when sellers bring inventory to sell, they have to pay transportation costs.
It maybe good to keep careful attention on the cash amount that sellers have available, as keeping their cash amount low would mean that they cannot bring inventory to sell, forcing them to sell to you cheaply at the next negotiation.
