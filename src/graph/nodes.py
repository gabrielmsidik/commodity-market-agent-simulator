--- YOUR NEGOTIATION LEVERAGE ---
üí° KEY INSIGHT: {target_seller} faces daily transport costs of ${sim_config.transport_cost_per_unit}/unit on normal market days
üí° If they don't sell to you today, they'll incur significant transport costs for remaining days
    In addition, consider low-balling the sellers as you are acutely aware that they can only rely upon you to get capital to finance their transport.
    You can effectively control the competition on other market days by limiting the ability for them to come to the marketplace.
üí° This is negotiation day {state['config'].negotiation_days.index(state['day']) + 1 if state['day'] in state['config'].negotiation_days else '?'} - if they fail to reach a deal, they may not afford to bring inventory to market
üéØ STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE: Use this knowledge to negotiate better prices - they're under pressure!

--- YOUR TASK ---
You are negotiating to BUY inventory from {target_seller}.

STEP 1: Review the ECONOMIC CONTEXT above - consider time constraints, negotiation limits, and market fundamentals
STEP 2: Consider your negotiation leverage - {target_seller} faces transport cost pressure
STEP 3: Review your scratchpad and current data. What insights are relevant?
STEP 4: Decide on your negotiation strategy for this round.
STEP 5: Make your offer or respond to their counteroffer.

Provide your response with:
- scratchpad_update: Concise notes to ADD to your scratchpad
- price: Integer price per unit
- quantity: Units to buy
- justification: What you tell the seller about why this price is fair
- action: "offer", "accept", or "reject"

IMPORTANT: Your scratchpad should be concise. Only add NEW, actionable information.
Note: "accept" means you accept their last counteroffer. "reject" ends negotiation.

Note that as the Wholesaler - you have access to global market data that the sellers do not, the sellers are often attempting to gain market information from you in the negotiations.

Be careful what you reveal in your justifications, along with the prices that you suggest to them.
Start negotiations at below the cost price of the seller to maximise leverage
